### Motivation

For our app, we have a section called "Tips" where dog owners can get useful tips on a daily basis. Every day, every app user is presented a new set of 3 tips which (s)he can share with her friends if desired. Because the editoral effort is very big, when the editor needs to create a new image for each tip, we seeked for a solution to fit our needs in a super easy way.

Upon research we stumbled uppon `imgkit` because our API is also written in Ruby. We are hosting our servers/droplets on Heroku, which made it a little harder for us to deploy `wkhtmltopdf` (which `imgkit` is using behind the scenes). So we searched for a much easier solution for our problem. So, I had `canvas` in mind. With `node-canvas` being a pretty stable solution for "backend" `canvas` support, we had our solution ready. And then, in no time, we had our image generation service ready to deploy in an easy way through Heroku. With the help of `node-canvas`.
